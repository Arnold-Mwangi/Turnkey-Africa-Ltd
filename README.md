## Assessments Q1
- Write a Java program that generates a Fibonacci sequence. The program should ask the user for an
input number and then print the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.
## * Fibonnaci
- Fibonnaci is a sequence where the current number is the sum of the two preceding ones in a sequence

## Assessments Q2
- Implement a function in Java programming language that takes a list of integers as input and
returns the largest difference between any two numbers in the list. For example, given the input
[1, 9, 3,7], the function should return 8, as the largest difference is between 1 and 9.

## * Maximum Difference
